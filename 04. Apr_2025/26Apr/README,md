# Is Binary Tree Heap
## Difficulty: Medium
## Points: 4
### Description:
You are given a binary tree, and the task is to determine whether it satisfies the properties of a max-heap.

A binary tree is considered a max-heap if it satisfies the following conditions:
- `Completeness:` Every level of the tree, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
- `Max-Heap Property:` The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

### Examples:
```
Input: root[] = [97, 46, 37, 12, 3, 7, 31, 6, 9]
```

```
Output: true
Explanation: The tree is complete and satisfies the max-heap property.
```
```
Input: root[] = [97, 46, 37, 12, 3, 7, 31, N, 2, 4] 
```
<img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/img-practice/prod/addEditProblem/881982/Web/Other/blobid1_1733648320.jpg"><br>
```
Output: false
Explanation: The tree is not complete and does not follow the Max-Heap Property, hence it is not a max-heap.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
- 1 ≤ `node->data` ≤ 10<sup>3</sup>
